      "Lab results show significantly elevated creatinine and BUN, indicating impaired kidney function.",
      "eGFR is severely reduced (25 mL/min/1.73m^2), consistent with CKD Stage 4.",
      "Hyperkalemia and anemia, also observed in labs, are frequent complications of advanced CKD.",
      "Significant proteinuria further supports the diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease."
